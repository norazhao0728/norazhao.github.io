Deploy
=================

Deploy a service by following these general steps:
* Instantiate a network
* Gather and validate data for an infrastructure service/network
* Instantiate an infrastructure service
* Post instantiation

###ã€€About infrastructure services
Infrastructure services describe VFs that are designed to meet the need for additional capacity in the network. Service Designers create the VFs/services that represent such capacity, and Operations representatives trigger the instantiation of the infrastructure service using the Virtual Instantiation Deployment (VID) GUI. These services are based on the need for additional capacity or the removal of deployed capacity.
Example infrastructure service type:
* mobile
* layer 3
* layer 4+
* cloud

### Capacity planning
Before triggering VF instantiation, ensure the capacity and resources required by each VF in a service are available.
